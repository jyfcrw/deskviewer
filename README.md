# Deskviewer
A open source, cross platform Remote Desktop solution (C&amp;S).

## My Goal
Make a open source teamviewer/anydesk. So that any people, any companies are able to host their own relay servers, use the remote desktop client unlimited. 

## Road Map
Two main part.
1. A p2p client.
2. A relay server.

## Lisence
GPLv3
